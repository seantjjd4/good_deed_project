# Good Deed Network Project

## Overview

The Good Deed Network Project leverages the non-exclusivity and transparency of blockchain technology to issue a token called Good Deed Token (GDT) on the Sui network. This token is subject to the strict limitations of Sui's closed loop token system and serves as a reward for philanthropic activities.

Due to the closed loop token restrictions, GDT can only be traded through authorized third-party platforms. It cannot be directly interacted with or transferred through wallets or blockchain explorers like Sui Explorer. This ensures that philanthropic actions cannot be bought or sold for monetary gain.

## Project Structure

This project can be divided into two main components: Smart Contracts and Front-End.

1. **Smart Contracts:** Developed using Sui-Move, providing a rigorous and secure development environment.
2. **Front-End:** Built with React in conjunction with SDK packages, interacting with the contracts using Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTB).

## Project Objectives

1. **Promote Philanthropy:** Encourage and reward individuals for engaging in philanthropic activities.
2. **Ensure Token Integrity:** Maintain the integrity of the GDT by restricting its transfer and trade capabilities to authorized platforms only.
3. **Collaborate with Non-Profit Organizations:** Partner with third-party non-profit organizations to oversee the distribution of GDT tokens.
4. **Provide Reward Mechanisms:** Allow recipients of GDT tokens to spend them on specific rewards offered by partnered stores, government agencies, or public welfare institutions without transferring the tokens to the merchant. Instead, the tokens are destroyed to ensure GDT only represents contributions to public welfare and has no monetary value.

## Token Distribution and Management

- **Controlled Circulation:** The distribution of GDT tokens is managed by our team, ensuring a controlled and secure flow of tokens.
- **Authorized Partners:** Only authorized third-party platforms can facilitate the trading of GDT tokens, preventing direct wallet interactions.
- **Non-Profit Distribution:** Non-profit organizations partner with us to distribute GDT tokens as rewards to individuals participating in philanthropic activities.

## Usage of GDT Tokens

- **Redeeming Rewards:** Recipients can spend GDT tokens on specific rewards offered by partnered stores, government agencies, or public welfare institutions.
- **Token Destruction:** GDT tokens are destroyed upon redemption, ensuring they do not transfer to merchants or partners and retain no monetary value.

## Collaboration with Non-Profit Organizations

We collaborate closely with non-profit organizations to ensure the fair and accurate distribution of GDT tokens. These organizations verify the participation of individuals in philanthropic activities and distribute tokens accordingly. This collaboration ensures that GDT tokens remain a symbol of genuine public welfare contributions.

## Conclusion

The Good Deed Network Project aims to harness the power of blockchain technology to promote and reward philanthropic activities while ensuring the integrity and non-monetary value of the GDT tokens. Through strategic partnerships and controlled token management, we aim to create a sustainable and transparent system that encourages public welfare contributions.
